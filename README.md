# Background
The multigrid method is meant to fix the issues that arise when using numerical solvers such as the jacobi method.
This project uses the multigrid method to solve for numerical solutions to poisson's equation, assuming a square boundary with dirichlet boundary conditions, 
as well as a square heat source inside the grid.
It includes an implementation of the V-cycle multigrid method, as well as an implementation of the Full Multigrid (FMG) method.
